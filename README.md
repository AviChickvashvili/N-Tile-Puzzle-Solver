# N-Tile-Puzzle-Solver
I created an N-Tile puzzle solver , using graph search algorithems

Such as :BFS ,DFBnB, DFID ,IDA , A*.

to play the game the user should enter :

  size of the board, what algoritham to choose , inital state , and goal state. 

  for example: 
BFS
with time
no open
3x4
1,2,3,4
5,6,11,7
9,10,8,_
Goal state:
1,2,3,4
5,6,7,8
9,10,11,_
  
  
  
  the game will return the path to the solution , the path is gurenteed to be the shortest and the most efficent you can find.
  Enjoy.
